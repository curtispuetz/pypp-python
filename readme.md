# Py++ Python

This library should be install for every [Py++](https://pypp-docs.readthedocs.io/) project.

Though it is not required to be able to transpile Py++ code to C++, if you want to be able to run your Py++ code with the Python interpreter or to have a better IDE experience, this library is needed.

Bug reports should be submitted to the Py++ project.
